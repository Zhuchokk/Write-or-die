Save yourself 4 helpful tips on how to focus on work quickly.

1. Make a plan for the day, write down all the tasks you need to accomplish today, and set a time for them. Nothing helps you stay focused on work like a visual to-do list.
2. If you are often distracted by a colleague's business, then give everyone a certain time. This way you will be able to complete all tasks and completely immerse yourself in the problems of others.
3. Set aside time in your plan for rest, for example, you work for an hour, rest for 10 minutes.
4. Do not start your working day by reading your personal mail or social networks, as you can get stuck in the news, entertainment publics and lose your working spirit for a long time.
